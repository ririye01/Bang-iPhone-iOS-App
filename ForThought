1. Is the current method of saving the classifier blocking to the tornado IOLoop? Justify your response.

  Yes, because we aren't making it asynchronous.

2. Would the models saved on one server be useable by another server if we migrated the saved
documents in MongoDB? Justify your response

  Yes. The data can be the same, although the app would need some changes to be able to take in those models.
